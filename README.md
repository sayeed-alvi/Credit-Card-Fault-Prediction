# Introduction
Generally real world classification problems suffer from class imbalance which means when classes are not in equal proportions and leads to futile high accuracy.
There are many ways of dealing with such cases. In this project various resampling techniques like Random Over Sampling, Random Under Sampling, SMOTE etc have been attempted to solve the problem.
In addition, a loss function was designed for calculating false positive cost and false negative cost as a performance metric to be optimized. Higher cost was given to the person who is bad but classified as good.
